Welcome! Please find more information in the welcome post below, or if you're ready to start a project, use the contact link above.

We offer the most complete, affordable IT services in the Denver/NoCo area. From network audit reports, hardware purchase recommendations, network architecture/configuration, server architecture/installation, to custom data integrations and software, FCS can do it all!

FCS primarily operates in the Denver/Northern Colorado area, but we'd be happy to help you remotely if you're outside of our area. We have experience with a wide range of technologies and can help you with your IT needs. 

Starting in 2025, we are pleased to offer cloud consulting services. We can help you with your cloud migration, cloud cost optimization, and cloud security needs. We have experience with AWS, Azure, and DigitalOcean.
If a cloud provider isn't for you, we'd love to help you out building an on-prem solution. We have experience with Proxmox, VMWare, and Hyper-V. We can help you with your virtualization needs, as well as your storage needs. 

If you're interested in learning more about Fries Consulting Services, please feel free to reach out at the [contact form](/contact/) or view our [welcome post](/posts/welcome/) to see how we can help with your IT needs.
