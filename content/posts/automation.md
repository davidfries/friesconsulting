Automation is more than turning lights on and off at certain times or controlling HVAC with outside temperature fluctuations. It is something that can save businesses many man hours, especially tasks that require human interaction. Every department in a business can benefit from some form of automation. 

Some examples of automation tasks that can help save time for general office use would be combining many PDFs into one document for printing purposes, or copying/pasting data from one spreadsheet to another as part of a daily task. It could also be batch renaming files in a directory or comparing devices on a network between days of the week. There are countless other examples of automation that a business can take advantage of that will enable higher productivity and employee mental health. 

It is even possible to automate software that does not have an API such as accounting or custom software. A recent job was done to automate clicking through reporting software that has no way of scheduling reports to be run and exported. This will save hundreds of hours throughout the year that would be spent pointing and clicking a mouse and typing the same filename format every week.
