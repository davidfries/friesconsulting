We recently performed a full internal network audit for a client that from a physical point of view was in decent shape. It wasn’t until we started to dig into the logical networking that things became more incoherent. Their logical network choices caused issues that plagued them for over half a year before we were able to sort things out.

Internal network audits offer a detailed view into the devices on your network, how they’re connected, what network access they have, and automated reports to show changes in devices. This ensures that devices are on the proper VLAN, network switches are configured correctly, and automated reports can help keep mischievous users in check.  

We performed our network audit and was then contacted shortly after for an issue that hadn’t been solved by any on-site staff. We used the information we gathered during our network audit to assist in figuring out their issue. The issue turned out to be internal VLAN assignment issues, as well as multicast routing issues between switch brands. No network documentation was provided during our initial engagements because there had never been any created in the IT department. Logically stepping through the documentation we gathered during the audit helped us quickly identify and solve their critical issue before a pressing deadline.

If this sounds like something your company needs or it has been awhile since a deep-dive was performed on your network, feel free to give us a call  or contact us above!
